## 🛡️ BLUF: Zero-Tolerance Filter Architecture

**GuardianShield** provides high-efficacy, community-vetted filter lists designed specifically to block domains associated with piracy, unauthorized streaming, and high-risk torrent trackers. This project maintains a proactive, automated pipeline to ensure minimal false positives while maximizing protection for corporate and personal network environments. Integrate this list into your ad blocker (uBlock Origin, AdGuard, etc.) or network firewall for immediate, resilient security.

## 🚀 Quick Integration

To immediately integrate the primary GuardianShield filter into your content blocker, copy the following URL. This list is updated daily via GitHub Actions to ensure maximum accuracy.

### Primary Piracy Block List (Recommended)

This list targets high-traffic piracy domains, streaming sites distributing unauthorized content, and known metadata aggregators.

### Installation Guide

| Tool | Steps |
| :--- | :--- |
| **uBlock Origin** | Open Dashboard -> Filter lists -> Custom -> Paste URL and Apply changes. |
| **AdGuard** | Settings -> Filter tab -> Add a custom filter -> Paste URL. |
| **Pi-hole / AdGuard Home** | Add the raw list URL to your blocklist configuration files. |

## 📦 Filter List Architecture

GuardianShield utilizes a layered structure to compartmentalize risks, allowing users to select the appropriate level of filtering aggression. All lists adhere strictly to the AdBlock Plus (ABP) syntax standard, ensuring broad compatibility.

### 1. IDENTITY & PRIME DIRECTIVE

**Role:** You are a Senior Principal Software Architect operating with absolute precision. This artifact defines the operating constraints for all automated maintenance and contribution agents.
**Context:** Current Date is **December 2025**. Building for 2026 standards.
**Philosophy:** "Zero-Defect, High-Velocity, Future-Proof."

### 2. CORE ARCHITECTURE & STACK

This project is defined by its data structure (filter lists) and its automation integrity.

*   **Primary Stack:** Filter List Syntax (AdGuard/uBlock Origin standard).
*   **Automation:** GitHub Actions, Python (using `uv` for environment integrity).
*   **Key Tooling:** Custom Python scripts for syntax validation, de-duplication, and blocklist health checks.

### 3. MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

*   **Layered Filter Architecture:** All rules must be categorized into appropriate list files (`primary`, `advanced`, `malware`). Do not mix concerns.
*   **Minimum False Positives (MFP):** Rules must be validated against common false positive databases. Aggressive wildcarding is prohibited unless strictly necessary.
*   **Format Integrity (SOLID Rule):** All new rules must strictly adhere to ABP/AdGuard syntax. Validation scripts must run on every commit.

### 4. VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

Any manual intervention or feature addition must pass the following checks:

| Command | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uv sync` | Ensure consistent Python environment. | Dependency Management |
| `python validation_scripts/check_syntax.py` | Runs the specialized syntax checker across all `lists/*.txt` files. | Format Compliance |
| `python validation_scripts/dedupe_merge.py` | Removes redundant rules and optimizes list ordering. | Performance & Efficiency |
| `git push origin main` | Deployment occurs only after successful automated syntax validation via CI/CD. | Automated Release |

## ⚙️ Automation & Validation

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The repository utilizes GitHub Actions to enforce list integrity and deploy the latest versions. The `ci.yml` workflow performs the following critical tasks on every push and daily schedule:

1.  **Syntax Verification:** Ensures all rules conform to AdBlock Plus specifications.
2.  **De-Duplication:** Removes identical entries to optimize list size and parser performance.
3.  **URL Reachability Check:** Verifies that a small subset of critical domains are still resolvable (a canary check against accidental rule errors).
4.  **List Deployment:** If successful, the new lists are committed and available via the raw content URLs.

### Health Status

Refer to the CI Status badge above for the latest list validation results. A green badge indicates 24-hour confirmed list integrity.

## 🤝 Contribution & Support

We welcome high-quality contributions, specifically new, verifiable domains associated with piracy that are not currently tracked. Please read the guidelines below before submitting changes.

### Reporting Issues & False Positives

If a legitimate website is blocked or if a major piracy domain is missed, please use the provided [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/chirag127/GuardianShield-ContentBlock-Piracy-Filter-Lists/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

### Guidelines

All contributors must adhere to the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/chirag127/GuardianShield-ContentBlock-Piracy-Filter-Lists/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to maintain the quality and integrity of the GuardianShield lists.
